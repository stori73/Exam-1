        <p> Self Introduction</p>

        <p>Completed by: Tori Namanny</p>

        <p> My favorite culture that Im not native to is the Thai culture. </p>

        <p> Two historical figures I can relate too most are John Lennon for his love for music and Amelia Earnhart for her strength and courage. </p>

        <p> A meal that represents me would be chicken tortilla soup. I love to make soups. </p>

        <p> Im most creative in the morning after I have some coffee or hot tea. </p>
